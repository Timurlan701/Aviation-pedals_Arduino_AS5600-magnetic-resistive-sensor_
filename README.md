# Aviation-pedals_Arduino_AS5600-magnetic-resistive-sensor_
In this example, using the ArduinoJoystickLibrary and Seed_Arduino_AS5600 libraries, aviation pedals are created based on the AS5600 magnetic resistive sensor, recognized by Windows using I2C as an Arduino Micro gaming device. Remember that the AS5600 sensor can be flashed once. If the firmware fails, that is, not at the right angles, then every time you connect the USB to the computer, you will have to set the corners of the extreme position again using the "full_function" sketch of the Seed_Arduino_AS5600 library.
